# core-crypto

Purpose: A Rust crate intended to house cryptographic primitives, key management abstractions, and protocol message type definitions for Codezh.

Status: Placeholder scaffold — no cryptographic code or protocol logic is implemented here. This crate exists to provide a clear place for future, audited implementations.

Guidelines:
- Keep all crypto implementations reviewable and well-documented.
- Prefer small, well-audited primitives; production implementations must be externally reviewed.
