# server

Purpose: Rust backend server for Codezh. This directory will contain the server application, HTTP/GRPC endpoints, and runtime scaffolding.

Status: Placeholder — no server logic or networking implemented in this scaffold.

Notes:
- Use Rust async ecosystem (e.g., `tokio`, `axum`, or `hyper`) for implementation decisions in future iterations.
- Keep security and privacy-by-default as primary design goals.
