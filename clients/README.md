# clients

Purpose: Top-level directory for client applications (web, mobile, desktop). Each subfolder contains the client platform's scaffold and contributing notes.

Status: Placeholders — no client implementations included. Each platform should be developed in its own repository or workspace crate depending on ecosystem choices.
