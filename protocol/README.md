# protocol

Purpose: Protocol design and RFC-style documentation for message formats, wire protocols, and versioning for Codezh.

Status: Placeholder directory for specifications. All protocol changes should follow an RFC process and be stored here for review.

Conventions:
- Use sequential RFC files (`rfc-XXXX.md`) with motivation, specification, and security considerations sections.
